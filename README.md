Car Sales Prediction Deployment with Flask

This is a web application that predicts the expected price of a car based on its features using a machine learning model. The app is built using Flask, a Python web framework, and deployed on Heroku.

How to Use

To use the app, simply go to the following URL: https://car-sales-prediction-flask.herokuapp.com/

Once you're on the app page, enter the car's features, such as the year, mileage, make, model, and location, into the input form. Then click on the "Predict" button to get the expected price.

Note that the predictions are based on a machine learning model trained on a dataset of car sales data, and are therefore estimates. The actual sale price may differ from the predicted value.

Prerequisites

The app requires Python 3.x and the following packages to run:

Flask
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
You can install these packages by running the following command in your terminal:

Copy code
pip install flask scikit-learn pandas numpy
References

This project was inspired by a Kaggle dataset on car sales data. The machine learning model was trained using the Random Forest algorithm in scikit-learn. The Flask app was deployed on Heroku, a cloud platform for web apps.
